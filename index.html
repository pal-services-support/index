        <p>The bottom line is that your customer service department is the face of the company for your customers. Any experience that they have is primarily a direct outcome of the quality and skill of the team. 

            Hence, any strong business will look to harness the power of customer service to develop positive relationships with the clients. But if you are a proactive company, you will keep asking the questions, “What is good customer service?”
            
            The core value of outstanding customer service is centralized around attending to the needs and expectations of your customers through careful listening. Therefore, to prevent the relationship from stagnating, you have to be constantly looking out for newer and innovative opportunities for experience enhancement. </p>

   <p>Besides image file format and sizing, there are other ways to make sure your images are working hard for you on the SEO front.

    You can signal relevancy of your content to search engines by using keywords for your image file name, alt tag, title, description and caption.</p>
